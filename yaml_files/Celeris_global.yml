title: FRF Currituck Sound, CS01 SBE26+ waves
summary: >
   USACE/CHL/COAB collected non-directional wave data using a Seabird Electronics SBE26+
   pressure sensor at Currituck Sound station CS01. Record are collected every half hour 
   in bursts of 4096 samples collected at 4 Hz. Frequency spectra were computed using 512 point 
   ensembles and the Welch method of 50% ensemble overlap.  Spectra were smoothed with 
   3-point frequency band averaging then interpolated to 0.01 Hz bands between 0.04 and 
   0.5 Hz. A linear wave theory pressure correction (PRF) is applied to the pressure spectra 
   to get surface variance spectra. PRF corrections exceeding 100x in energy are not applied 
   at the high frequency end of the spectra.
